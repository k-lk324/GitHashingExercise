# GitHashingExercise

## Description

I have developed a Bash script that takes a 4-digit integer as input, generates a hash of the input using a hashing algorithm, and saves the output in a file named `hash_output.txt`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd GitHashingExercise
    ```

2. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x hash_script.sh
    ```

3. Run the script with a 4-digit integer as input:
    ```bash
    ./hash_script.sh 1234
    ```

4. The hash output will be saved in `hash_output.txt`.
